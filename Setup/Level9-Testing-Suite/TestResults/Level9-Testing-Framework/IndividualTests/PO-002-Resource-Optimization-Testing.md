## Test Objective
Test memory and CPU optimization features under various load conditions

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Adaptive priority testing passed (PO-001)
- [ ] Multiple instances available for load testing
- [ ] Performance monitoring tools configured

## Test Steps
1. Enable memory optimization with enableMemoryOptimization=true
2. Enable CPU optimization with enableCpuOptimization=true
3. Enable resource rebalancing with resourceRebalancingEnabled=true
4. Generate controlled memory pressure and monitor optimization response
5. Generate controlled CPU load and monitor optimization response
6. Test resource rebalancing between multiple instances
7. Measure optimization effectiveness and response time

## Expected Results
- Memory optimization reduces memory usage under pressure
- CPU optimization improves performance under high load
- Resource rebalancing distributes load effectively between instances
- Optimization changes occur within configured intervals
- System stability maintained during optimization

## Pass Criteria
- [ ] Memory usage reduced by at least 15% under optimization
- [ ] CPU performance improved by at least 10% under optimization
- [ ] Resource rebalancing maintains system stability





## Optimization Settings
Optimization Configuration:
- enableMemoryOptimization: true
- enableCpuOptimization: true  
- resourceRebalancingEnabled: true
- optimizationInterval: 300s
- performanceThresholds: memory 80%, CPU 85%
