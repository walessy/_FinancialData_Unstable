# Trading Platform Test Case: SETUP-001
## System Resource Verification

**Test ID**: SETUP-001  
**Category**: Foundation Setup  
**Priority**: P0  
**Automation**: Full  
**Created**: 2025-07-29  
**Framework**: Level 9 Trading Platform Testing

---

## Test Objective
Validate system has sufficient resources to run trading platform instances

## Prerequisites
- [ ] System powered on and stable
- [ ] Administrative access available
- [ ] Resource monitoring tools accessible

## Test Steps
1. Check available system memory (minimum 4GB required)
2. Verify disk space (minimum 10GB free required)
3. Test network connectivity to trading servers
4. Validate CPU performance (minimum requirements)
5. Check system stability under initial load

## Expected Results
- Memory >= 4GB available
- Disk space >= 10GB free
- Network latency < 100ms to trading servers
- CPU can handle baseline load
- System passes resource validation checks

## Pass Criteria
- [ ] All minimum resource requirements met
- [ ] Network connectivity established
- [ ] System stable and ready for trading platform


## Configuration Example
```json
{
  "resourceChecks": {
    "minimumSystemMemory": "4GB",
    "minimumDiskSpace": "10GB", 
    "networkLatencyThreshold": "100ms",
    "cpuLoadThreshold": "80%"
  }
}
```
