# Trading Platform Test Case: PO-001
## Adaptive Priority Testing

**Test ID**: PO-001  
**Category**: Performance Optimization  
**Priority**: P1  
**Automation**: Full  
**Created**: 2025-07-29  
**Framework**: Level 9 Trading Platform Testing

## Test Objective
Test dynamic priority adjustment based on system load conditions

## Prerequisites
- [ ] System monitoring tools configured
- [ ] Multiple instances available for testing
- [ ] Load generation tools available

## Test Steps
1. Enable adaptive priority monitoring (interval=30s, optimization=300s)
2. Start multiple instances at normal priority
3. Generate high CPU load (>80%) and monitor priority changes
4. Generate memory pressure (>80%) and test response
5. Return to normal load and verify priority restoration
6. Test edge cases and recovery scenarios

## Expected Results
- High Load (CPU >80%): Lower priority for non-critical instances
- Memory Pressure (RAM >80%): Aggressive memory management
- Normal Load: Standard operation restored
- Priority changes occur within optimization interval

## Pass Criteria
- [ ] Adaptive priority responds correctly to load conditions
- [ ] System performance improved under stress
- [ ] Recovery to normal priorities when load decreases





## Configuration Parameters
```json
{
  "enableAdaptivePriority": true,
  "monitoringInterval": "30s",
  "optimizationInterval": "300s",
  "cpuThresholds": {"high": "80%", "normal": "50%"},
  "memoryThresholds": {"high": "80%", "normal": "60%"}
}
```
