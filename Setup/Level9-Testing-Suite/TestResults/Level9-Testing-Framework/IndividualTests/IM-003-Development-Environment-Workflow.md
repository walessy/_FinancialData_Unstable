# Trading Platform Test Case: IM-003
## Development Environment Workflow

**Test ID**: IM-003  
**Category**: Instance Management  
**Priority**: P1  
**Automation**: Partial  
**Created**: 2025-07-29  
**Framework**: Level 9 Trading Platform Testing

## Test Objective
Validate EA development workflow with primary, testing, and backup instances

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Multiple instance testing passed (IM-002)
- [ ] Development data folders configured
- [ ] Test EA files available

## Test Steps
1. Configure Dev_Primary instance (autoStart=true, priority=high)
2. Configure Dev_Testing instance (autoStart=false, priority=normal)
3. Configure Dev_Backup instance (enabled=false)
4. Start system and verify primary auto-starts
5. Manually start testing instance
6. Enable and start backup instance on demand
7. Verify data folder isolation between instances
8. Test EA deployment to each instance

## Expected Results
- Primary instance auto-starts successfully
- Testing instance starts manually when requested
- Backup instance remains disabled until needed
- EA deployment works correctly on each instance
- Data isolation prevents interference between instances

## Pass Criteria
- [ ] Development workflow operates as designed
- [ ] No data conflicts between instances
- [ ] EA deployment successful on all instances


## Configuration Example
```json
{
  "Dev_Primary": {"autoStart": true, "priority": "high", "dataFolder": "Dev_Primary_Data"},
  "Dev_Testing": {"autoStart": false, "priority": "normal", "dataFolder": "Dev_Testing_Data"},
  "Dev_Backup": {"enabled": false, "dataFolder": "Dev_Backup_Data"}
}
```
