# Trading Platform Test Case: AS-001
## Intelligent Dependency Chain Startup

**Test ID**: AS-001  
**Category**: Automation & Sequencing  
**Priority**: P0  
**Automation**: Full  
**Created**: 2025-07-29  
**Framework**: Level 9 Trading Platform Testing

## Test Objective
Test intelligent sequencing with dependency chains and failure handling

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Instance management tests passed
- [ ] Dependency chain configuration prepared
- [ ] Monitoring tools active

## Test Steps
1. Configure dependency chain: MT4 → MT5 → TraderEvolution
2. Set stability wait time to 45 seconds
3. Set maximum startup time to 300 seconds
4. Start dependency chain sequence
5. Monitor each step for successful completion
6. Test failure scenarios (MT4 fail, MT5 fail, timeout)
7. Verify failure handling and recovery procedures

## Expected Results
- Normal sequence: All platforms start in 195 seconds or less
- MT4 failure: Sequence stops immediately
- MT5 failure: Sequence stops at MT5 step
- Timeout scenario: Emergency shutdown triggered
- Recovery procedures execute correctly

## Pass Criteria
- [ ] Successful dependency chain completion
- [ ] Proper failure detection and handling
- [ ] Emergency procedures function correctly



## Test Scenarios
Test Matrix:
Normal: MT4 Success → MT5 Success → TE Success (Expected: All running in 195s)
MT4 Fail: MT4 Fail → Stop (Expected: Sequence stops)
MT5 Fail: MT4 Success → MT5 Fail → Stop (Expected: Sequence stops at MT5)
Timeout: MT4 Success → MT5 Timeout → Emergency (Expected: Emergency shutdown)
