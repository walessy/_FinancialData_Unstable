# Trading Platform Test Case: IM-002
## Multiple Instance Dependencies

**Test ID**: IM-002  
**Category**: Instance Management  
**Priority**: P0  
**Automation**: Partial  
**Created**: 2025-07-29  
**Framework**: Level 9 Trading Platform Testing

---

## Test Objective
Test multiple trading platform instances with different configurations and dependencies

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Single instance testing passed (IM-001)
- [ ] Multiple configuration files prepared
- [ ] Isolated data folders created

## Test Steps
1. Configure MT4 Demo instances (1-5) with sequential delays
2. Configure MT4 Live instances (1-3) with staggered delays
3. Configure MT5 Demo instances (1-3) with random delays
4. Configure TraderEvolution instances (1-2) with fixed delays
5. Start all instances and monitor startup sequence
6. Validate data folder isolation between instances

## Expected Results
- All instances start in correct sequence
- No conflicts between instance types
- Data folders remain isolated
- Memory usage stays within system limits
- Network connections established for each instance

## Pass Criteria
- [ ] All configured instances operational
- [ ] Data isolation maintained
- [ ] System performance within acceptable limits




## Stress Test Matrix
Stress Test Scenarios:
Scenario A: 5 MT4 + 3 MT5 + 2 TE (10 total instances)
Scenario B: 3 MT4 + 2 MT5 + 1 TE (6 total instances)  
Scenario C: 1 MT4 + 1 MT5 + 1 TE (3 total instances)
