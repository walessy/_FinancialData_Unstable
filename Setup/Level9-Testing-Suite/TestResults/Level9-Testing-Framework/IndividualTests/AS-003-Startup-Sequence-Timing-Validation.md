# Trading Platform Test Case: AS-003
## Startup Sequence Timing Validation

**Test ID**: AS-003  
**Category**: Automation & Sequencing  
**Priority**: P1  
**Automation**: Full  
**Created**: 2025-07-29  
**Framework**: Level 9 Trading Platform Testing

## Test Objective
Test precise timing control in startup sequences with various delay configurations

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Basic dependency chain testing passed (AS-001)
- [ ] Multiple instances configured for timing tests
- [ ] Precision timing measurement tools available

## Test Steps
1. Configure instances with sequential delays: 0s, 15s, 30s, 45s, 60s
2. Configure instances with staggered delays: 0s, 30s, 60s
3. Configure instances with random delays: 0-60s range
4. Start sequence and measure actual vs expected timing
5. Test timing precision under different system loads
6. Validate timing consistency across multiple runs

## Expected Results
- Sequential delays accurate within ±2 seconds
- Staggered delays maintain proper intervals
- Random delays fall within specified range
- Timing consistency maintained under normal system load
- Timing degradation minimal under high system load

## Pass Criteria
- [ ] Timing accuracy within acceptable tolerance
- [ ] Consistent performance across multiple test runs
- [ ] Graceful degradation under system stress




## Delay Patterns
Delay Patterns Tested:
- Sequential: 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 seconds
- Staggered: 0, 30, 60 seconds  
- Random: 0-60 second range
- Fixed: 0, 45 seconds
