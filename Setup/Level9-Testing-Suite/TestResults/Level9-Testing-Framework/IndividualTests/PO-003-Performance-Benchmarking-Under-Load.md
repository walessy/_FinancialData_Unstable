# Trading Platform Test Case: PO-003
## Performance Benchmarking Under Load

**Test ID**: PO-003  
**Category**: Performance Optimization  
**Priority**: P1  
**Automation**: Full  
**Created**: 2025-07-29  
**Framework**: Level 9 Trading Platform Testing

## Test Objective
Establish performance benchmarks and validate system behavior under sustained load

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Resource optimization testing passed (PO-002)
- [ ] Load generation tools configured
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics established

## Test Steps
1. Establish baseline performance with single instance
2. Gradually increase load with additional instances (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
3. Monitor memory usage, CPU utilization, and response times
4. Test sustained load over extended period (30+ minutes)
5. Measure performance degradation curve
6. Test recovery time after load reduction
7. Document performance thresholds and breaking points

## Expected Results
- Linear performance degradation up to 6 instances
- Memory usage remains below 85% with up to 8 instances
- CPU utilization stays below 90% with up to 6 instances
- Response times remain acceptable (<5s) up to capacity limits
- System recovers to baseline within 60 seconds after load reduction

## Pass Criteria
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet or exceed minimum requirements
- [ ] System remains stable under maximum tested load
- [ ] Recovery time within acceptable limits
