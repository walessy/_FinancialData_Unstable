## Real-World Context

User Story: As an EA developer, I need isolated testing environments where I can backtest strategies without affecting live trading operations. Business Value: Proper EA development environments are crucial for algorithmic trading success and risk management.

## Configuration Example

```json
{
  "devEnvironment": {
    "backtestingInstance": {
      "name": "Development_MT4_Backtest",
      "purpose": "Strategy backtesting",
      "autoStart": false,
      "memoryLimit": "1GB"
    },
    "forwardTestInstance": {
      "name": "Development_MT4_Forward",
      "purpose": "Forward testing", 
      "autoStart": false,
      "memoryLimit": "1GB"
    },
    "productionInstance": {
      "name": "Production_MT4_Live",
      "purpose": "Live trading",
      "autoStart": true,
      "priority": "high"
    }
  }
}
```

## Test Steps

1. Create three separate MT4 instances for different purposes
2. Configure backtesting instance with historical data
3. Setup forward testing with demo account
4. Configure production instance with live account
5. Test isolation between development and production
6. Verify backtesting performance and resource usage
7. Test strategy migration from backtest to forward test to live
8. Validate that development work does not impact live trading


---

## Pass Criteria

✅ Three instances operate independently
✅ Backtesting completes without timeout
✅ Development changes do not affect production
✅ Resource usage manageable across all instances
✅ Strategy deployment pipeline works smoothly
