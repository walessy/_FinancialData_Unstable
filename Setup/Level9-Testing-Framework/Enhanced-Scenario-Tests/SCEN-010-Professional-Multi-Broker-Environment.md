## Real-World Context

## Configuration Example

```json
{
  "instances": [
    {
      "name": "ICMarkets_MT4_Live",
      "broker": "ICMarkets",
      "accountType": "live",
      "priority": "high",
      "startupDelay": 0
    },
    {
      "name": "AfterPrime_MT5_Live", 
      "broker": "AfterPrime",
      "accountType": "live",
      "priority": "high",
      "startupDelay": 30
    },
    {
      "name": "FTMO_MT4_Demo",
      "broker": "FTMO", 
      "accountType": "demo",
      "priority": "normal",
      "startupDelay": 60
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Test Steps

1. Configure three different broker platforms
2. Set high priority for live accounts, normal for demo
3. Implement staggered startup to prevent resource conflicts
4. Test simultaneous operation of all three platforms
5. Verify broker-specific settings are isolated
6. Test failure recovery - if one platform crashes, others continue
7. Validate live account connections are stable
8. Test resource allocation under full load


---

## Pass Criteria

✅ All three platforms start reliably in sequence
✅ Live accounts connect before demo accounts (priority)
✅ Total system memory usage less than 2GB
✅ No cross-broker configuration interference
✅ Platform failures are isolated (do not cascade)
